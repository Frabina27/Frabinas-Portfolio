      <p className="project-description">
        I designed the UI/UX for MeteorMate, a student-focused roommate matching platform. 
        MeteorMate helps students find compatible roommates through a simple and engaging interface.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          Students often struggle to find roommates with compatible lifestyles and preferences. 
          MeteorMate was created to simplify this process, helping students connect with suitable roommates quickly and confidently. 
          The existing system was inefficient and stressful, so we aimed to build a better solution.

      {/* User Needs & Research */}
      <section className="project-section">
        <h2>User Needs & Research</h2>
        <p>
          We spoke with students and conducted surveys to understand their challenges. 
          The main needs were compatibility in lifestyle, clear information, and ease of communication. 
          Students wanted an interface that was simple, engaging, and helped them find roommates they would feel comfortable living with.

      {/* Main Features */}
      <section className="project-section">
        <h2>Main Features</h2>
        <p>
          The platform allows users to create profiles with personal information and preferences, answer a set of compatibility questions, and search or filter potential roommates by dorm, major, habits, and interests. 
          These features guide students step by step to find compatible matches efficiently.

      {/* Design Process */}
      <section className="project-section">
        <h2>Design Process</h2>
        <p>
          I followed a standard design process. First, I empathized with students to understand roommate challenges. 
          Then I defined key pain points like compatibility, clarity, and communication. 
          Next, I ideated features such as matching questions, filters, and chat. 
          After that, I created interactive Figma prototypes for profiles, cards, and chat screens. 
          Finally, I tested the flows with peers and iterated on layout and usability.

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          For MeteorMate, I designed the full UI/UX flow from account creation to profile setup, preferences, and the main matching dashboard. 
          I created interactive Figma prototypes, tested layouts and flows, and updated the design to match branding and usability goals. 
          The final design guides students through creating a profile, inputting preferences, and exploring compatible roommate matches, all in a clear, engaging, and easy-to-use interface.
