        Eunoia reimagines workplace wellness in a fun and unique way!
        Inspired by CBRE’s human-centered approach, we designed a gamified digital environment where mood check-ins and team growth feel like leveling up in a pixel adventure game. 
        Our goal was to make workplace wellness interactive, accessible, and enjoyable.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          Eunoia was designed during a 24-hour design-a-thon to combat remote worker burnout by prioritizing breaks, hydration, walks, and more! 
          The project aimed to transform personal wellness into an engaging experience that encourages self-reflection, collaboration, and consistent progress.

        <h2>Primary Research</h2>
        <p>
          We researched workplace wellness trends and human-centered design practices, focusing on ways to make wellness fun and engaging. 
          Key insights included the importance of mood tracking, visual feedback, and something to encourage regular participation.

        <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          We analyzed existing wellness apps and gamified productivity tools, noting that none of them provided the features we were looking for in one location.
          Eunoia’s design addressed these gaps with interactive dashboards, avatars, and level progression.

        <h2>Feature 1: Pomodoro</h2>
        <p>
          We realized how important time management is when working remotely. 
          We designed a Pomodoro timer to help users stay on track with their work while also reminding them to take breaks.

        <h2>Feature 2: Daily Tasks</h2>
        <p>
          We designed Daily Tasks to help users build healthy habits and stay productive every day.
          From drinking enough water and taking a walk to using the Pomodoro timer, completing tasks earns coins and motivates users to keep up with their daily goals.

          We built Character Customization so users can bring their avatars to life.
          Use the coins you earn from completing daily tasks to unlock outfits, accessories, and fun items! This makes the characters fully customizable while maintaining motivation to reach daily wellness goals.
