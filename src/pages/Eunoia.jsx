      <p className="project-description">
        Eunoia reimagines workplace wellness through play, aligning with the design prompt to create spaces that power people. 
        Inspired by CBRE’s human-centered approach, we designed a gamified digital environment where mood check-ins and team growth feel like leveling up in a pixel adventure game. 
        Our goal was to make workplace wellness interactive, accessible, and genuinely enjoyable.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          Eunoia was designed during a 24-hour design-a-thon to combat worker burnout by prioritizing breaks and wellness. 
          The project aimed to transform team wellness into an engaging experience that encourages self-reflection, collaboration, and consistent progress.

        <div className="info-card">
          <p>
            We researched workplace wellness trends and human-centered design practices, focusing on ways to make wellness fun and engaging. 
            Key insights included the importance of mood tracking, visual feedback, and gamified incentives to encourage regular participation.

          <p>
            We analyzed existing wellness apps and gamified productivity tools, noting that most lacked emotional engagement or team collaboration features. 
            Eunoia’s design addresses these gaps with interactive dashboards, avatars, and team-level progression.
